    <section>
      <p>Not all work that moves the field forward fits into the model of a standard conference paper or conference talk. The memorability or intellectual impact of work is often inextricably linked to this non-conventional form, whether it is a reflection, provocation, critique, satire, artistic statement, or manifesto. Successful venues like ACM CHI’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/alt-chi">alt.chi</a> (“a forum for controversial, risk-taking, and boundary pushing research at CHI”) and various “unconferences” have emerged in the past years as a way of providing an outlet for this sort of unconventional work.</p> <p>Visualization, and IEEE VIS specifically, which incorporates perspectives in the intersection between art and design, statistics and psychology, we believe is uniquely placed to both generate and value the non-traditional. What’s more, we observed a long-running desire for an outlet for non-traditional work among both long-time attendees as well as those researchers or practitioners who do not currently feel welcome or appreciated in the IEEE VIS environment.</p> <p>Therefore, based on the (often unexpected) utility of unconventional work, the long standing and successful models of “alternative” conferences, and an expressed interest in bringing these models to the IEEE VIS community, we founded an “alt.VIS” workshop in 2021 as a venue for work that is otherwise difficult to place in the main conference for reasons of form, format, or topic.</p>
      <p>The remit of this workshop, mirroring alt.CHI, is relatively broad both in terms of scope of topics and presentation types: our selection criteria are more focused on impact. What sort of work might cause the field to rethink its priorities or ways of operating? What work might highlight under-explored or neglected areas of visualization study or application? What, as per Kant, would “interrupt [our] dogmatic slumber” and stir us to action?

      <h1>Call for Submissions</h1>
      We invite the submission of bold, provocative, unusual, unconventional, thought-provoking works related to visualization in the broad sense. The deadline for submissions is <b>June 30, 2023, End of Day (AoE)</b> (submission details coming soon). 
        Note that the submission itself does not need to have the form of a traditional conference paper: You are welcome to use any template format or medium that works for your submission (this can include, but is not limited to, the familiar TVCG conference format). While alternative presentations (such as websites, videos, zines, or comics) are welcome, each work must include a PDF submission for archiving purposes including at least a title, author names*, an abstract. 
        Traditionally written works should be no longer than 4000 words (not including references). 
        <!-- Notifications of acceptance will be shared by <b>Wednesday, August 31st, 2022</b>.</p> -->

      <p>Examples of submissions we encourage include (but are not limited to):</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Provocations, manifestos, or other critiques of visualization research and practice</li>
        <li>Creative and thought-provoking presentations of data (especially unconventional data), either as traditional visualizations or as multimedia presentations or artworks</li>
        <li>Novel and unconventional visualization techniques or design processes</li>
        <li>Hands-on activities and artworks of all mediums.</li>
        <li>(Kind and civil) critiques to other works.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- <ul>
        <li><b>Position papers or ‘meta-papers’</b> that address topics such as: how mentors in the visualization community presently or should ideally respond to failure; implementation of iterative design principles to visualization research workflows; the role of community critique in development and evaluation of methods; pedagogical strategies; the development of ethical guidelines for visualization research standards; and the contextualization of alternative visualizations within VIS.</li>
        
        <li><b>Debates or panel discussions</b> among position paper authors and/or mid- or senior-level career visualization practitioners sharing: stories of personal experience with research failure; discussions about the role of VIS; ideas for improving community experience and engagement; well-elucidated frustrations; conversations about pedagogical strategy; and guest input from visualization practitioners. Call for panelists will launch immediately pending workshop acceptance; debates will be formed around accepted position papers that share topical similarities but perhaps differences in opinion.</li>
        
        <li><b>Lightning talks</b> are intended for early career researchers or other community members who may be just beginning to launch an idea or project within the context of alt.VIS. We hope to offer the floor to those with curiosity and drive, but perhaps lacking the resources or lengthy development to craft a full-fledged paper or formal talk.</li>

        <li><b>Hands-on activities</b> will be vital to maintaining high energy during the workshop, and integral to building a long-term community around alt.VIS, making the workshop a staple of VIS conferences for years to come. If the conference is primarily in-person, we intend to mitigate under-caffeination and postprandial somnolence with brightly-colored activities, movement around the physical workshop space, and short periods of spirited creative collaboration in small breakout groups.  </li>

        <li><b>Artworks</b> of all mediums will be accepted to alt.VIS. Participatory artworks are encouraged for the development of hands-on activities. Artworks are welcomed in non-traditional formats, and they will be shared on the alt.VIS workshop website, as well as promoted on social media. </li>

        <li><b>Traditional format short- and medium-length papers</b> are welcome at alt.VIS, under the condition that they could not be reasonably published in the main conference or other workshops. Examples based on the previous editions of the workshop are: publication of alternative mediums for visualization, critical reflections (such as criticisms of previous published works, or habits of the VIS community that might be usefully called into question), explorations of negative results, or a survey about the VIS community itself.</li>

        <li><b>Responses or critical papers</b> will allow authors to give a concrete place in which they can critique or challenge the work presented in another paper. The objective of this submission form is to foster discussion and improvement for accepted work. As platforms for critique are scarce in visualization, this experimental submission format will allow submitters to demonstrate how critique might be usefully surfaced in the VIS community. A kind approach to critiques will be requested by everyone involved.</li>
      </ul> -->


      <p>Submissions will be evaluated on clarity, novelty, and their ability to promote productive thought and discussion for the alt.VIS audience.  The purpose of this venue is to provide a place for works that fall outside of the purview of the main VIS paper program, and so submissions that would be more at home in the main track are unlikely to be accepted. Please consider taking a look at the submissions from <a href="2022.html" target="_blank">last year’s alt.VIS 2022</a> for inspiration!
         </p>

      <!-- <p><b>This year, we are introducing the Weirdy Awards which celebrate bizarre or thought-provoking ideas, presentations, or submissions.</b></p> -->

      <p>Accepted submissions will be made publicly available on the workshop’s webpage. Authors are also welcome and encouraged to archive on their repository of choice, e.g. OSF, ArXiv. Submissions will not be archived within the main IEEE VIS conference archive.</p>
