      <p>Not all work that moves the field forward fits into the model of a standard conference paper or conference talk. The memorability or intellectual impact of work is often inextricably linked to this non-conventional form, whether it is a reflection, provocation, critique, satire, artistic statement, or manifesto. Successful venues like ACM CHI’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/alt-chi">alt.chi</a> (“a forum for controversial, risk-taking, and boundary pushing research at CHI”) and various “unconferences” have emerged in the past years as a way of providing an outlet for this sort of unconventional work.</p> <p>Visualization, and IEEE VIS specifically, which incorporates perspectives in the intersection between art and design, statistics and psychology, we believe is uniquely placed to both generate and value the non-traditional. What’s more, we observed a long-running desire for an outlet for non-traditional work among both long-time attendees as well as those researchers or practitioners who do not currently feel welcome or appreciated in the IEEE VIS environment.</p> <p>Therefore, based on the (often unexpected) utility of unconventional work, the long standing and successful models of “alternative” conferences, and an expressed interest in bringing these models to the IEEE VIS community, we founded an “alt.VIS” workshop in 2021 as a venue for work that is otherwise difficult to place in the main conference for reasons of form, format, or topic.</p>
      <p>The remit of this workshop, mirroring alt.CHI, is relatively broad both in terms of scope of topics and presentation types: our selection criteria are more focused on impact. What sort of work might cause the field to rethink its priorities or ways of operating? What work might highlight under-explored or neglected areas of visualization study or application? What, as per Kant, would “interrupt [our] dogmatic slumber” and stir us to action?

  <p>with a list of your desired papers from the submissions <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://openreview.net/group?id=IEEE.org/2022/Workshop/altVIS#all-submissions">here</a>. We permit reviewers with conflicts of interest (COIs) to still review, with their conflicts (same lab, former co-author, etc.) declared in the review body. You are invited to review as many papers as you are interested in, and reviewers will have the option to allow their reviews to be published alongside the final version of the paper. All reviews will be overviewed by a meta-reviewer. We particularly like  <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://jts3blog.wordpress.com/2016/12/23/tips-for-being-a-good-visualization-paper-reviewer/">"Tips for being a Good Visualization Paper Reviewer" by John Stasko</a> as a resource, with the note that alt.VIS does not use a scoring system for papers and includes an additional acceptance criteria of weirdness (could not be published at any other venue at VIS).

      <h1>Call for Submissions [CLOSED]</h1>
      <p>We invite the submission of bold, provocative, unusual, unconventional, thought-provoking works related to visualization in the broad sense. Authors should <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=IEEE.org/2022/Workshop/altVIS"  target="_blank">submit their work via OpenReview here</a> by End of Day (AoE) <b>Friday, July 29th, 2022</b> [deadline updated!].
        Note that the submission itself does not need to have the form of a traditional conference paper: You are welcome to use any template format or medium that works for your submission (this can include, but is not limited to, the familiar TVCG conference format). While alternative presentations (such as websites, videos, zines, or comics) are welcome, each work must include a PDF submission for archiving purposes including at least a title, author names*, an abstract. 
        Traditionally written works should be no longer than 4000 words (not including references). 
        Notifications of acceptance will be shared by <b>Wednesday, August 31st, 2022</b>.</p>

      <p>Examples of submissions we encourage include (but are not limited to):</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Provocations, manifestos, or other critiques of visualization research and practice</li>
        <li>Creative and thought-provoking presentations of data (especially unconventional data), either as traditional visualizations or as multimedia presentations or artworks</li>
        <li>Novel and unconventional visualization techniques or design processes</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Submissions will be evaluated on clarity, novelty, and their ability to promote productive thought and discussion for the alt.VIS audience.  The purpose of this venue is to provide a place for works that fall outside of the purview of the main VIS paper program, and so submissions that would be more at home in the main track are unlikely to be accepted. Please consider taking a look at the submissions from <a href="2021.html" target="_blank">last year’s alt.VIS 2021</a> for inspiration!
         </p>

      <p><b>This year, we are introducing the Weirdy Awards which celebrate bizarre or thought-provoking ideas, presentations, or submissions.</b></p>

      <p>Accepted submissions will be made publicly available on the workshop’s webpage and archived on the HAL. Authors are also welcome and encouraged to archive on their repository of choice, e.g. OSF, ArXiv. Submissions will not be archived within the main IEEE VIS conference archive.</p>

      <p>If you are unsure of how to submit your work, or if you want to discuss your submission with us, do not hesitate to contact us at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" target="_blank" href="@mailto:alt.vis.workshop@gmail.com" >alt.vis.workshop@gmail.com</a></p>
