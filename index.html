      <br>
      <p>Not all work that moves the field forward fits into the model of a standard conference paper or conference talk. The memorability or intellectual impact of work is often inextricably linked to this non-conventional form, whether it is a reflection, provocation, critique, satire, artistic statement, or manifesto. Successful venues like ACM CHI’s <a target="_blank" href="https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/alt-chi" target="_blank">alt.chi</a> (“a forum for controversial, risk-taking, and boundary pushing research at CHI”) and various “unconferences” have emerged in the past years as a way of providing an outlet for this sort of unconventional work.</p> <p>Visualization, and IEEE VIS specifically, which incorporates perspectives in the intersection between art and design, statistics and psychology, we believe is uniquely placed to both generate and value the non-traditional. What’s more, we observed a long-running desire for an outlet for non-traditional work among both long-time attendees as well as those researchers or practitioners who do not currently feel welcome or appreciated in the IEEE VIS environment.</p> <p>Therefore, based on the (often unexpected) utility of unconventional work, the long standing and successful models of “alternative” conferences, and an expressed interest in bringing these models to the IEEE VIS community, we founded an “alt.VIS” workshop in 2021 as a venue for work that is otherwise difficult to place in the main conference for reasons of form, format, or topic.</p>
      <p>The remit of this workshop, mirroring alt.CHI, is relatively broad both in terms of scope of topics and presentation types: our selection criteria are more focused on impact. What sort of work might cause the field to rethink its priorities or ways of operating? What work might highlight under-explored or neglected areas of visualization study or application? What, as per Kant, would “interrupt [our] dogmatic slumber” and stir us to action?

      <h1>Call for Reviews</h1>

      <p>This year, alt.VIS is using OpenReview for submission reviews. We rely on the VIS community to volunteer additional reviews, so please consider signing up to be a reviewer when we open sign-ups! (Link TBA)</p>

      <h1>Call for Submissions</h1>
      <p>We invite the submission of bold, provocative, unusual, unconventional, thought-provoking works related to visualization in the broad sense. Authors should submit their work via OpenReview by <b>Friday, July 22nd, 2022</b>. Given the wide range of submission formats that alt.VIS encourages, the only hard requirement is that an alt.VIS submission must include a title, author names*, an abstract, and a PDF submission of no longer than 2500 words (not including references). Note that the submission itself does not need to have the form of a traditional conference paper: You are welcome to use any template format that works for your submission, and websites or videos are welcome. However, we do ask that websites, videos, etc. also include a PDF submission for archiving purposes. Notifications of acceptance will be shared by <b>Wednesday, August 31st, 2022</b>.</p>

      <p>Examples of submissions we encourage include (but are not limited to):</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Provocations, manifestos, or other critiques of visualization research and practice</li>
        <li>Creative and thought-provoking presentations of data (especially unconventional data), either as traditional visualizations or as multimedia presentations or artworks</li>
        <li>Novel and unconventional visualization techniques or design processes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please consider taking a look at the submissions from <a href="2021.html" target="_blank">last year’s alt.VIS 2021</a> for inspiration!</p>
      <p>Given our focus on work that does not yet have a home in the main conference, we are unlikely to accept work that could conceivably be accepted to a main conference track. Submissions will be evaluated on clarity, novelty, and their ability to promote productive thought and discussion for the alt.VIS audience. <b>This year, we are also introducing the Weirdy Awards, so please ensure your submission is sufficiently bizarre to warrant consideration for the awards.</b></p>
      <p>Accepted submissions will be made publicly available on the workshop’s webpage. They will be archived on the HAL but authors are also welcome and encouraged to archive on their repository of choice, e.g. OSF, ArXiv. Submissions will not be archived within the main IEEE VIS conference archive.</p>
      <p>If you are unsure of how to submit your work, or if you want to discuss your submission with us, do not hesitate to contact us at <a target="_blank" href="@mailto:alt.vis.workshop@gmail.com" target="_blank">alt.vis.workshop@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p><em>* Authors serving in workshop organizing roles should include a COI statement in their PDF.</em></p>

      <p><b>NOTE FOR EU SUBMITTERS:</b> The alt.VIS workshop is <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/faq-theme/compliance/" target="_blank">Plan S compliant. <img src="img/plan_s.jpeg" width="60px"></a></p>
